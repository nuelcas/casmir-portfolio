      <h1 class="teach-phil">Teaching Philosophy</h1>
      <p>After gaining some teaching experience, I learned that teaching requires  so much more than simply 
        loving children and wanting to help them learn.
      </p>
      <p>I would first like to define my thoughts on the purpose of education.
        We are told we are suppose to prepare children for citizenship, and to teach them the skills and knowledge 
        to live on their own and have the life they always wanted, to obtain a college degree, 
        get the job they want, etc.  
        All of which requires educators to teach their students literacy and to help them become critical thinkers, 
        but recently I read a quote by Noam Chomsky that really stuck with me and encompassed all of this, 
        plus so much more.  The quote read: “Education is really aimed at helping students get to the point where 
        they can learn on their own”.  If students have the ability  to learn on their own, 
        they have gained the knowledge, skills, and insight necessary to become successful citizens and independent 
        men and women who can achieve anything their hearts desire.  
        If a teacher can teach a student to learn on their own, they have succeeded as an educator.
      </p>
      <p> After reading quotes like this, and observing many different teachers and teaching styles, 
        I have come to learn that the underlying reason that I want to teach because I truly believe 
        that every child can succeed and learn if they are simply given the opportunity to do so.  
        This requires me, the teacher, to take the time to get to know each and every student 
        (including both their learning styles and information about their families), 
        keep open communication with their parents, learn what their hobbies are, 
        and then applying all of this information and use it to engage the students in a way 
        that will help them succeed.  In my classroom, I will take the time to ask students questions 
        about their hobbies, their favorite things to do, and, without asking too directly, 
        questions about their personal life or household environment so I can understand each student better.
      </p>
      <p>I will implement their personal experiences and connections to the curriculum by giving examples 
        they can relate to, have them write about topics that pertain to them such as their personal narratives, 
        and relate social studies to their own backgrounds whenever the opportunity arises.  
        I will also plan numerous parent teacher conferences, make phone calls to the house, 
        and make sure it is understood that I have an open door policy for emails and phone calls.
      </p>
      <p>All in all, I believe that the only teaching philosophy I can write on paper and deeply devote 
        my time to trying to accomplish this: that teaching requires learning and growth.  
        As musician Phil Collin’s quotes in his lyrics, “In learning you will teach, 
        and in teaching you will learn.”  The students need to learn and grow as students, individuals, 
        friends, and members of society, but the teachers also to do the same.  
        Teachers need to learn from their peers, their mentors, and most importantly their students.  
        Perhaps the principle lesson I have learned is that as a teacher, you need to be flexible.  
        I have come to realize that nothing ever goes as planned, but the best teachers are the ones 
        who are flexible and able to adapt his or her plans each and every day.  
      </p>
      <p>In the years to come, I want to teach by curiosity, caring, and encouragement.  
        I hope to teach fearlessly, entirely, respectfully, expressively, emotionally, and with love.  
        If I can encompass all of these qualities, along with having the ability to remain adaptable 
        and understand that everything is a learning experience, 
        I believe that I will be the best teacher I can possibly be.

          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p class="about">My name is Onyekani Amamchukwu Casmir(Cas), an enthusiastic science educator providing creative lessons and engaging
            classroom instruction to promote the goals of literacy, critical-thinking, problem solving,
            collaboration skills and applications to everyday life for all students.
          </p>
          <p>I have Bachelors degree in Computer Science Education.
            I have over 7 years of experience in teaching and mentoring. I first had my teaching experience as 
            a student teacher in 2008 and final teaching practice in 2010 all in Abakaliki, Ebonyi state.
            As a student teacher, I created lessons that engaged all learners by applying a variety of 
            teaching methods; organizing individual projects and implementing targeted lessons for small groups.
            I combined the traditional test assessment method and performance assessments to evaluate my students.
            As part of teacher training, I conducted a research project "Effects of computer games on Junior secondary school
            students's achievement in Algebra in Abakaliki Education Zone of Ebonyi State".
          </p>
          <p>I am a person who thrives on helping others, seeing others happy, and having fun. I love working with children, 
            and have done so since I was 15 years old. I worked with children in numerous ways; baby-sitting,
            tutoring, running kids summer classes, and afterschool programs for elementary school children. 
            As a senior in high school I began engaging junior students in sports; football, handball, high jump and long jump. 
            With experience working with a wide range of students in numerous settings, I have a diverse background with 
            much to offer in an elementary and junior high schools.
            I am passionate about teaching children. I believe that building close relationships with students 
            is the foundation of a well-run classroom. Through this process I can help them build a sense of 
            confidence and enable them to grow as learners. It is my goal to incorporate my prior experience in 
            a school setting as well as my additional work experience to be an empathetic, passionate, enthusiastic, 
            intelligent teacher who will make a positive contribution to your school.
            In addition, I like travelling; it is part of education. I travelled to Qatar and China in 2013 and 2014, I also
            plan to tour more countries in future.
